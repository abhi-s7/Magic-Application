# Magic-Application

This app is for magicians. Since magicians use a variety of tools to trick us into believing the unreal, this is a tool that will help them perform a magic trick. It is based on the dynamic changing of QR codes. A QR code is a machine-readable code consisting of an array of black and white squares, typically used for storing URLs or other information for reading by the camera on a smartphone. The magician generates a QR code. That QR can be shared in form of a JPEG file to the person who is being shown the trick, which on scanning through the phone, will redirect to the browser and show the backside of a deck card. Once the magician performs his/her trick and changes the card through the app, then upon scanning the same QR code, the changed card is shown, even though the QR code and the URL inside the QR code remain the same.

It also have a silent mode. When enabled, the screen goes fully blank and the magician performs the same trick using the gestures to select the card and change them. A voice is being played upon every card change, which the magician can hear using a bluetooth earphone.
